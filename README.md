# Capstone

This analysis was carried out using Logistic Regression, Decision Tree and Naive Bayes models and crss validation was also performed on the dataset for all the models listed.

Data Reprocessing was carried out to handle missing data, encode variables with Label encocoder and cate numerical features using StandardScaler before the training models and evaluations were carried out. 

This is the initial part of the model and more work will be done to analyse Bias and Fairness before final work will be submitted


Performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall and F1 score were calculated.
